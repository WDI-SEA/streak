How's it going <%= @user.name %>?

Here at General Assembly, we love you. Which is why we need to give some tough love...

-- You haven't committed to Github recently. --

<% if @user.snapshot %>
It's been **<%= time_ago_in_words(@user.snapshot.last_push) %>** since you've pushed. But don't worry, you can get back on track! We believe in you :)
<% end %>

What you should do now

- Pick a project to work on. It can be an existing project that you want to add more features to. Or it can be an entirely new one. (Hint: keeping your project small will help motivate you to complete it.)
- Plan out and write some clean code.
- Add, commit, and push to Github
